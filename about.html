            <h1>About Bagun Esports</h1>
            <p>
                First off it's pronounced "buh-goon" and we've a bunch of 16-17
                year olds from Bulgaria who love playing PVP games mostly on ps4
                but now on PC as well. The clan was first created for Destiny 1
                when everyone loved the game, but as time went on no one really
                stuck around, however the time for Destiny 2 came around and
                Bungie descided to create a reward system for clans so the gang
                was back together. The first year of Destiny 2 was some of the
                best time for this clan, but the PVP was not what it used to be,
                ultimately everyone stopped playing that as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rainbow Six Siege was the game to bring back hope for the clan.
                When everyone got it, Dark was the first to start playing
                competitively as always, and soon after the rest followed. The
                first few months were chill as no one knew really how to play
                and only admired the pros. Dark and ManiacMaxo started duo
                queueing to reach that diamond rank, but school and M&K cheaters
                would not allow that. They peaked at low Platinum 2.
            </p>
            <p>
                From the good old days of Black Ops 3 custom games to evolving
                into actual professionals, the Bagun clan has come a long way.
                Now only 4 of the original 13 play regularly but some others
                have also joined.
